# Sentiment Analysis

# Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the Stock Sentiment Analysis project. The project aims to analyze stock sentiment using natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. By analyzing and classifying sentiment from news articles, tweets, and other textual data related to a particular stock, we can gain valuable insights into market sentiment and potentially predict stock price movements.

# Background
Understanding stock sentiment is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Sentiment analysis involves determining whether the sentiment expressed in a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we leverage natural language processing techniques and machine learning models to perform sentiment analysis on various textual sources related to specific stocks.

# Features
Collects data on Dow Jones(stock) from news articles, headlines.
Preprocesses and cleans the textual data for analysis.
Utilizes popular sentiment analysis techniques, including lexicon-based methods and machine learning models.
Visualizes sentiment trends over time to provide insights into market sentiment dynamics.
Evaluates the performance of different models using appropriate metrics.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-sentiment-analysis.git
cd stock-sentiment-analysis
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Usage
Make sure you have activated your virtual environment (if you created one).

Prepare your data: Place your textual data (news articles, tweets, etc.) in the data/ directory.

Preprocess the data: Use the preprocessing scripts provided to clean and format the data for analysis.

Train and evaluate models: Run the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to train various sentiment analysis models and evaluate their performance.

Visualize results: Use the visualization scripts to create insightful plots and graphs that demonstrate sentiment trends.

# Data
The data used in this project is not included in this repository due to licensing and copyright issues. However, we provide sample data in the data/ directory for demonstration purposes. You should replace the sample data with your own dataset for meaningful analysis.

# Models
The project includes several models for sentiment analysis, including:

Lexicon-based methods (VADER, SentiWordNet)
Machine learning models (Logistic regression, etc.)

# Evaluation
We assess the performance of the sentiment analysis models using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

---- Scores ----
The accuracy score is: 83.86%
The precision score is: 0.85
The recall score is: 0.83
